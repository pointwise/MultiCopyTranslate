# MultiCopyTranslate

A Pointwise Glyph script to copy/paste one or more entities multiple times using a single anchor point and one or more selected end points.

The script will use pre-existing selection or will enter interactive selection mode if nothing is selected.
Pick a single anchor point and as many target points as desired. A copy of all selected entities (including parent entities) will be made and translated
using the anchor point and each selected end point.
